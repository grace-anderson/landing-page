## Description

This is a starter project to create an interactive landing page by adding javascript to a static site created with HTML and CSS

## Topic

To make the project interesting, the topic of mountain bike techniques is used (my favourite hobby)

## Objectives

The objectives of the project are :
* to create a dynamic navigation menu, that is capable of expanding if sections are added to the page (e.g. when we donâ€™t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API )
* when a user clicks on a navigation item, the page scrolls to the anchor tag destination. Colour is used to show the user which navigation item they clicked on. 
* colour is used on the navigation menu and a change to background colour to show which section is active, which is also the section the user viewing. 
* a button displays when user is viewing 'below the fold'. Clicking the button takes the user to the top of the page.
* ensure the page is responsive and able to be viewed successfully on all screen sizes.
