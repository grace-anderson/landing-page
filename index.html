        <h2>Attack Position</h2>
        <p>
          Attack Position is used when the trail becomes steep, rocky, or otherwise filled with sketchy technical
          features. In general, Attack Position may be described as having your butt up off the saddle with your weight
          evenly distributed on your pedals in a semi-standing posture, hips back, a deep bend in your elbows and knees,
          chest down and head up, looking down the trail. And don’t forget to keep your index fingers covering your
          brake levers. Also, the steeper the downhill, the further back your hips should be over the rear wheel.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here's how to use Attack Position when starting a steep descent. As a rider moves forward toward the descent,
          their upper body becomes more parallel with the top of the bike, the Attack Position. The faster you go, the
          more quickly you'll move forward. It’s important that you're not already in Attack Position as you approach
          the descent. Moving forward creates flexion, which then allows for extension (of the arms). This is a dynamic
          movement, so it’s important that the Attack Position is only held briefly as you move through into the
          descent. This will allow your arms to create extension naturally.

        <h2>Bunny Hopping</h2>
        <p>
          Bunny hopping is one of the most important skills any mountain biker can develop. Not only is bunny hopping
          useful in its own right to clear gutters, logs, rocks or anything else on the trail, it’s also critical as a
          gateway skill in learning to jump and pre-jump correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          This skill is also not something which is mastered in a day or two – give yourself months or even years to get
          comfortable and don’t get frustrated if you can’t get it straight away. It may seem impossible at first, but
          time and patience are the key ingredients to learning.

        <h2>Feathering</h2>
        <p>
          Most people don’t fully understand proper braking or when to brake. They either squeeze their brakes too hard
          or not at all. Feathering is, in a nutshell, using one or two fingers to lightly control the brakes. Start
          with both brakes, and then learn to control the front brake and the rear brake separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          About 80% of your power comes from the front brake. Basically, ignore your back brake, unless you absolutely
          have to (then, use the front first, and then add the back).
        </p>
        <p>
          Feathering the rear brake allows the front wheel to roll freely when you hit an obstacle such as rocks, roots,
          etc. If you use the front brake when you are going through technical sections two things could happen. First,
          if you panic and grab a handful of front brake, you go over the bars. If you grab a handful of rear brake and
          slide, the consequences may not be as severe. Secondly, the front tire is more likely to clear through the
          obstacles cleanly if you are not braking up front. You may still need to slow down, but not so much as you
          lose the momentum to carry you through the section. This can be done effectively by feathering the less
          powerful rear brake.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most important thing to remember: Learn how momentum and gravity are going to come into play when you hit
          those brakes. Shift back, push back on the bars, keep your knees and elbows bent, hold your grips as lightly
          as you can, and ride it, baby, ride it!

        <h2>Neutral Position</h2>
        <p>
          A mountain biker’s riding position for when the trail is flat or non-technical. The rider is sitting atop
          their saddle with a relaxed body, knees and elbows bent slightly, index fingers covering the brake levers, and
          weight evenly distributed on the pedals. A good, relaxed neutral position allows the rider to move into attack
          position quickly.

        <h2>Trackstand</h2>
        <p>
          A technique where a rider learns to maintain their balance on their bike while standing up on the pedals and
          either keeping the bike stationary or only moving around very little. Pedaling is not allowed for a regulation
          trackstand. Learning to trackstand on a flat surface give a rider an improved ability to negotiate difficult
          sections on the trail where they must roll extremely slowly and keep their balance.
